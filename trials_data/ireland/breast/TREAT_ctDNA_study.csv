Eligibility Criteria:,"Inclusion Criteria:

* ctDNA screening phase

  * Female or male patients with histologically confirmed ER positive (regardless of PR), HER2 negative breast cancer, according to local pathologist:

    * ER-positive defined as ≥ 10% of cells staining positive for ER
    * HER2-negative defined as a score of 0, 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a negative in situ hybridization (ISH) based on single-probe average HER2 copy number, as per American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines
  * Elevated risk of recurrence after definitive treatment for early breast cancer, defined as either:

    * Stage IIB or stage III disease according to the 8th edition of the UICC TNM classification and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, OR
    * Completion of at least 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and residual tumour at surgery of ≥ 1cm (≥ypT1c) or axillary node + (ypN+)
  * Pre- or postmenopausal status (for female patients).
  * Age ≥18 years
  * Patients must have received at least 2 years and up to 7 years of ET
  * Previous adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitor or PARP-inhibitor treatment is allowed if completed at least 12 months before registration
  * Patients with multifocal tumours are allowed provided all foci are biopsied and are ER-positive and HER2-negative as defined above
  * Available FFPE tumour block from the baseline biopsy or from surgical specimen or at least 10 slides of 10μm and a tumour cellularity of at least 25%. For patients with multifocal tumours, FFPE block or slides from the largest focus is required.
  * Written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.
* Randomised phase

  * ctDNA positive according to the Signatera ctDNA assay
  * Absence of locoregional and/or metastatic disease, as investigated by:

    * Mammogram (unilateral in case of mastectomy; not required in patients having undergone bilateral mastectomy)
    * CT thorax and abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. In case of any contra-indications (medical or regulatory): CT thorax without contrast + MRI abdomen/pelvis.
    * Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy
  * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1
  * Adequate organ function
  * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative highly sensitive serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to randomisation.

Exclusion Criteria:

* ctDNA screening phase

  * Suspected recurrent disease or known conflicts with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the randomised trial
  * Prior treatment with any SERD or investigational ER antagonist
  * Previous history of invasive breast cancer
  * Previous history of any other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix . Patients who have been disease free for more than 5 years with low risk of relapse are allowed
  * Bilateral breast cancer
  * Participation in another clinical study, with the exception of the SURVIVE study Note: patients participating in interventional studies may participate once they enter the follow-up period of the study
* Randomised phase

  * Any unresolved toxic effect of prior therapies or surgical procedures of Grade ≥ 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, with the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the participant at investigator's discretion
  * Unable or unwilling to avoid prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, dietary/herbal supplements, and/or foods that are moderate/strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 activity
  * Known difficulty in tolerating oral medications or conditions which would impair absorption of oral medications
  * Any of the following cardiovascular disorders within 3 months before enrolment:
  * Child-Pugh Score greater than Class A
  * Uncontrolled significant active infections (≥ grade 3 according to CTCAE version 5), including active hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
  * Coagulopathy or any history of coagulopathy within the past 6 months, including history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism"
