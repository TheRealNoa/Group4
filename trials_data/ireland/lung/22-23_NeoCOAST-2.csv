Eligibility Criteria:,"Inclusion Criteria:

* Newly diagnosed NSCLC patients with resectable disease (Stage IIA to Stage IIIB).
* WHO or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
* Adequate organ and bone marrow function.
* Provision of tumour samples (newly acquired or archival tumour tissue \[≤ 6 months old\]) to confirm Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status.
* Adequate pulmonary function.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Participants with sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK translocations.
* Participants with baseline PD-L1 expression status \<1% (Arms 6 and 7 only).
* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.
* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, active bleeding diseases, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhoea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement.
* History of another primary malignancy.
* Participants with small-cell lung cancer or mixed small-cell lung cancer.
* History of active primary immunodeficiency.
* History of non-infectious interstitial lung disease (ILD) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.
* Participants who have preoperative radiotherapy treatment as part of their care plan.
* Participants who require or may require pneumonectomy, segmentectomies, or wedge resections, as assessed by their surgeon at baseline, to obtain potentially curative resection of primary tumour.
* QTcF (QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula) interval ≥ 470 ms.
* Any medical contraindication to treatment with chemotherapy as listed in the local labelling.
* Participants with moderate or severe cardiovascular disease.
* Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational product, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.
* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study interventions.
* Prior exposure to approved or investigational immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other anti-CTLA-4, anti-TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD-L2 antibodies. Participants who received agents targeting the adenosine pathway, anti-NKG2A, anti-HLA-E agents, and anti-LIF agents are also excluded. Participants who have received previous treatment with a TROP2 targeting ADC or with another ADC containing a chemotherapy agent that inhibits TOP1 activity are also excluded.
* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of study interventions.
* Active or uncontrolled infections including HBA, HBV, HCV, and HIV."
