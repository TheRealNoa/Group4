Building a classification model using patient data to classify patients as either newly
diagnosed or relapsed into one of the following classes (Lung, Prostate, CLL,
Colorectal, and Breast cancers). The model should classify the patients and
recommend open cancer clinical trials in Ireland based on the cancer subtype.
Data sources for creating patient profiles based on newly diagnosed or relapsed
patients can be created using historical clinical trials for these disease groups.
